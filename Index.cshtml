        <h2>The Work We Do</h2>
        <p>
            ClaySys, as a technology consulting service provider, specializes in delivering IT solutions
            that make a positive impact on businesses. Our focus is not only on a successful technical
            implementation, but we are mindful of the business impact all through the project, to ensure
            we mould and tune the implementation to stay aligned with the key business objectives at all
            times. We work with a wide portfolio of technologies and products, to enable us to deliver
            real value to our customers and to provide consulting services to our customers with their
            existing investments in their technology platforms. If you have a defined requirement, our
            technology consultants would be able to plan, design and develop your custom solution, in
            most cases based on a fixed price engagement. The ability to engage on a fixed price basis
            is dependent on the client's solution requirements being defined in enough detail. We also
            have an option to support a client to initially create and finalize the requirements and design,
            at which point we could transition to a fixed price engagement for the development and final
            deliverable phase.
        </p>
        <h2>Why We Are Different</h2>
        <p>
            ClaySys has always focused on a partnership model and building long term relationships with
            our clients. So our focus is always the best interests of our clients, versus just a specific
            technology project. We believe in retaining key employees, as that ensures continuity of quality
            support to our clients, without the disruption associated with a constant churn and attrition with
            employees. Since we are a software product company as well, we try to adhere to the highest standards
            in terms of technology architecture, patterns, security practices, and solution scalability and
            maintainability.
